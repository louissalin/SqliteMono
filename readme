Manage users!

This was created to try out Mono's SQLite library and save users (or whatever) to a SQLite database. Unit tests were thrown in for extra fun! :)

More work would need to be done to hash passwords before saving the user. 
Also, for the sake of completeness, a DB layer should be created to allow the UserPersister class to be unit tested.


This project uses Mono and the .Net 4 profile.
It also uses Mono.Data.Sqlite, which might or might not work on Windows. You might have to install Mono to make it work. According to the Internet, this can be done. :)
